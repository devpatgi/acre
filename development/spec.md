Code Review Cadence CLI: Specification

Purpose

A command-line-first tool designed to help software engineers perform effective, efficient code reviews. The tool prioritizes reducing unreviewed lines to zero by supporting deep dives where needed and intelligent skimming/bulk-resolving elsewhere.

The tool integrates context-first review (PR summary, tickets, and epics) with a line-queue model for progress tracking.

⸻

Core Philosophy
	•	Treat a diff as a queue of lines to be resolved.
	•	Provide multiple ways to isolate, skim, or deeply review code until the number of unreviewed lines is zero.
	•	Emphasize risk-based prioritization: deep review on complex/critical changes, skim or bulk resolve on low-risk ones.
	•	Reduce reviewer fatigue by offering context summaries, semantic grouping, and incremental review capabilities.

⸻

Features

1. Overview Command

A first-step command that provides high-level context:

codereview overview

Output:
	•	PR summary text
	•	Linked Jira ticket description and any parent epic descriptions
	•	File summary: list of files changed with lines of code (LOC) changed per file

Example Output:

📌 PR Summary:
> Fixes login flow bug where 2FA could bypass SSO...
🔗 Jira: AUTH-2134 (Epic: AUTH-1900 "SSO Hardening")

📁 File Summary:
- core/auth.py         +87
- api/routes/login.py  +61
- tests/test_login.py  +102
- utils/logging.py     +4

🧮 Total: 10 files, 325 changed lines


⸻

2. Line Queue Engine
	•	Tracks and displays the count of remaining unreviewed lines:

codereview status
> 432 lines remaining | 68% reviewed | 12 files touched


	•	Marks review progress as lines are resolved (through deep or skim review).

⸻

3. Multi-Mode Review Resolution

Support for different review modes:

Mode	Description
🔍 Deep Dive	Step through lines/hunks one-by-one.
👀 Skim Mode	Lightly scan a group of lines and bulk-resolve them when deemed safe.
🧠 Semantic Grouping	Group changes logically (by class, function, module, or ticket) and review.
📁 File Mode	Mark an entire file as reviewed (useful for docs, vendor code, etc.).
🧹 Classify & Filter	Automatically filter out formatting-only or low-signal changes.

Example Workflow:

codereview group --by semantic

Groups:
1. login-flow logic (67 lines)
2. 2FA test cases (102 lines)
3. logging utils (4 lines)
4. doc updates (3 lines)

codereview review login-flow --skim
> Marked 67 lines as reviewed (skim mode)

codereview remaining
> 122 lines remaining in 4 groups


⸻

4. Semantic Chunker

Heuristics to automatically group related changes:
	•	By file type (e.g. group all tests together)
	•	By formatting-only changes
	•	By functional scope (class/function/module)
	•	By commit or commit message
	•	By dependency (files modified together frequently)

⸻

5. Complexity Prioritizer

Automatically highlight complex logic first:
	•	Cyclomatic complexity (loops, conditionals, nested blocks)
	•	New function/class definitions
	•	Imperative/bespoke logic over declarative or boilerplate code

⸻

6. Test Assertion Extractor
	•	Show only test names and assertions from changed test files:

codereview tests


	•	Skips mocks, fixtures, and setup code to reduce noise.

Example:

tests/test_login.py:
- test_login_with_valid_credentials
  assert login("user", "pass") == True
- test_login_with_invalid_2FA
  assert raises(AuthError, login("user", "bad_code"))


⸻

7. Documentation Suggestion Helper (Optional)
	•	Highlight unclear code and offer suggested inline documentation or PR comment templates.
	•	Integrates with GitHub’s suggested changes format.

⸻

Additional Managerial and Individual Impact Goals

For Engineers
	•	Timebox deep reviews; bulk-resolve low-risk code.
	•	Visible, thoughtful review comments to reflect diligence and insight.
	•	Skim mode encourages high-velocity reviews without skipping accountability.

For Managers
	•	Reduces bottlenecks in code review (shorter time-to-merge).
	•	Decreases downstream issues by emphasizing deep review for high-risk logic.
	•	Maintains auditability and context for review coverage.

⸻

Example End-to-End Workflow
	1.	Run overview:

codereview overview

Review PR summary, linked Jira tickets, and file summary.

	2.	Group and filter:

codereview group --by semantic
codereview filter --skip-formatting


	3.	Skim and bulk resolve safe groups:

codereview review tests --skim
codereview review docs --file-mode


	4.	Deep dive remaining critical logic:

codereview review core/auth.py --deep


	5.	Confirm zero remaining lines:

codereview status
> 0 lines remaining



⸻

Future Extensions
	•	GitHub API integration for posting approvals/comments
	•	Jira integration for pulling linked ticket data
	•	Team metrics: track review time, queue shrinkage, and coverage
	•	Configurable heuristics per project (risk scoring, grouping strategies)
